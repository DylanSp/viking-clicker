progress from Scandinavian farmer, to viking oarsman, to captain, to ruler

at the start: "Plow the stony earth". gives food, slowly
    a few upgrades, then an event happens where someone comes by and suggests going on raids

"Pull the oar". resource is distance to target...when hit target, get resources from raid


resources:
    food
    gold
    weapons
    armor? (how to differentiate from weapons?)
